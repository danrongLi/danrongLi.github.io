Hi, I'm a second year Ph.D. student at Penn State University in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and my advisors are [Prof. Young Kun Ko](https://youngkunko.github.io/) and [Prof. Stefan Canzar](https://canzarlab.com/).

Prior to that, I completed M.S. in Computer Science from NYU Tandon with [Prof. Christopher Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/) as my advisor.
