Hi, I'm a second year Ph.D. student at Penn State University in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and my advisors are Prof. Young Kun Ko and Prof. Stefan Canzar.

Prior to that, I completed M.S. in Computer Science from NYU Tandon with Prof. Christopher Musco as my advisor.
